pcejin takes the accurate PCE emulation core in Mednafen and gives it a native Win32 interface and additional features.

Mednafen-rr .mcm files can be loaded and converted with the Convert MCM menu item in the Tools menu, or the "Play Movie" hotkey.  A mc2 file will be placed in the same directory as the mcm.
